Statement of Work

Audience:

App Academy students learning a flask backend with wtforms for request
validations and a SQLAlchemy ORM, having previously learned react/redux
and express/sequelize backend.

Goals & Objectives:

Help students conceptualize and practice creating the connection between
flask and react by providing a familiar template in express/sequelize
and asking them to recreate it using the knowledge that they have of the
technologies involved. The application should also provide students with
the option to extend their application using cloud storage and websocket
technology, with guidance on how to use AWS S3 and socket.io to achieve
this.

Budget:

I have $0. That is the budget.

Deadline:

Project should be finished by January 31st, 2024.

Constraints:

 - Must use React/redux and express/sequelize
 - A hidden flask backend should be created as a "solution" file as well 
 - Backend API should be simple enough for a group of four beginner
    flask programmers to replace with a flask backend in about 6 hours
 - Backend should provide examples of many different database datatypes
 - Restful API should be utilized
 - The entire process should be well-documented from start to finish
 - The process should be used to explore git workflow
